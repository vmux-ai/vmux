# Rules

- Do not add comments to code.
- Do not use mod.rs files. Use the filename-based module pattern (e.g. `layout.rs` + `layout/` directory).

## Linear

When taking a Linear issue (e.g. "take VMX-XX"), immediately move it to **In Progress** before doing anything else — before creating a worktree, before reading code, before drafting a PR.

## Worktrees

**Never edit files on the main worktree.** All changes must happen inside a feature worktree. Before writing any code for a Linear issue:

1. Check if a worktree already exists: `git worktree list`
2. Create worktree if needed: `git worktree add .worktrees/vmx-<number> -b <branch-name>` — always name the worktree directory using the `vmx-<number>` convention matching the Linear issue (e.g., `.worktrees/vmx-88`).
3. `cd` into the worktree directory and make all edits there.
4. When done, merge to main, then remove: `git worktree remove .worktrees/<short-name>`
5. Remember: if the worktree is deleted while your shell is inside it, `cd` back to the repo root — `../..` won't work.

Worktree directory: `.worktrees/` (already in `.gitignore`).

## Documentation

- Save design specs to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` (not `docs/superpowers/specs/`).
- Save implementation plans to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` (not `docs/superpowers/plans/`).
- Delete the plan file once the plan is fully implemented.

## Before Pushing

Always run lint and test before pushing to catch CI failures locally:

```sh
make lint  # runs fmt --check + clippy -D warnings
make test  # runs cargo test --workspace
```
